-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install cmake pkg-config
    sudo apt-get install mesa-utils libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
    sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libglm-dev
    sudo apt-get install libao-dev libmpg123-dev

GLFW Library:
    cd /usr/local/lib/
    sudo git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
    sudo apt install libxinerama-dev
    sudo apt install libxcursor-dev
    sudo apt install libxi-dev
    cd glfw/
    sudo cmake .
    sudo make
    sudo make install

OpenGL Functions from GLAD Web Service:
    1. Head on to the GLAD web service.
    2. Set the language to C++ and choose the specification as OpenGL.
    3. In the API section, select gl version of at least 3.3, make sure the profile is set to Core, and that the Generate a loader option is ticked.
    4. Ignore the extensions and click Generate to produce the resulting library files.
    5. GLAD, by now, should have provided you a zip file: glad.zip containing two folders(include and src).
    6. Copy the folders inside include (glad and KHR) into your include(s) directory: cp -R include/* /usr/include/
    7. Now copy the file glad.c inside the src folder to your current working directory.

GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)
    1. Download header files from https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases/tag/0.9.9.8 and add to /usr/include/

OpenGL - 3D Graphics Specification Implemented by GPU makers
GLEW - OpenGL Extension Wrangler - Loads binary functions from GPUs into C++ code
GLAD - GL Loader-Generator - Similar to GLEW
GLFW - Graphics Library Framework - Helps manage things such as windows, basic IO, events, etc.
GLUT - Same as GLFW but older?
